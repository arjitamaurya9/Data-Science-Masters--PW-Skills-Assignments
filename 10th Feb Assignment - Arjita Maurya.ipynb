    "Files in Python can be opened with a built-in open() function. Ideally, it takes two string arguments:\n",
    "\n",
    "The file path including the file name and the extension we want to open, is to be passed as a string\n",
    "The mode in which we want to open the file, to be passed as a string.\n",
    "Thus, the syntax for opening a file would look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "open(“”, “”)\n",
    "Indeed there are other arguments as well in the open() function which are optional and are used as per the requirement of the user. Let’s look at an example for opening a file. Suppose if we have a file named myfile.txt on our desktop, it can be opened by:\n",
    "\n",
    "open(“C:UsersRahulDesktopmyfile.txt”)\n",
    "Unquestionably, if our current working directory of the Python file is the same as our file (here desktop), there is no need to specify the full path. In such a case, our open() function would look like:\n",
    "\n",
    "open(“myfile.txt”)\n",
    "For the ease of code implementation, let us consider our current working directory the same as the location our text files are present for the rest of the article.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has a wide range of file opening modes available by default. These modes specify in which mode our file needed to be opened. Each file opening mode comes with its default functionality and one can select the appropriate model based on the need. As discussed above, the file opening mode argument is an important factor that decides whether we want to read, write or update the contents of an existing file.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "File Opening Modes in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Mode\tDescription\tExample\n",
    "- r\tRead mode. Opens the file for reading (default mode). If the file doesn’t exist, an error will be raised.\tfile = open('example.txt', 'r')\n",
    "- w\tWrite mode. Opens the file for writing. If the file exists, it will be truncated. If the file doesn’t exist, it will be created.\tfile = open('example.txt', 'w')\n",
    "- a\tAppend mode. Opens the file for writing, but appends new data to the end of the file instead of overwriting existing data. If the file doesn’t exist, it will be created.\tfile = open('example.txt', 'a')\n",
    "- x\tExclusive creation mode. Opens the file for writing, but only if it doesn’t already exist. If the file exists, an error will be raised.\tfile = open('example.txt', 'x')\n",
    "- b\tBinary mode. Opens the file in binary mode instead of text mode.\tfile = open('example.txt', 'rb')\n",
    "- t\tText mode (default). Opens the file in text mode instead of binary mode.\tfile = open('example.txt', 'rt')\n",
    "- '+'\tUpdate mode. Opens the file for both reading and writing.\tfile = open('example.txt', 'r+')\n",
    "\n",
    "The modes discussed above are being used on a text file. To use these modes for a binary file, we need to use a different combination of file opening mode arguments. Using ‘b’ with any mode, For example, ‘ab’, ‘rb’, ‘wb’, ‘rb+’, the file opens in binary mode. It is used for non-textual files like image, sound, executable (.exe) files.\n",

    "For Example, To open our file myfile.txt in b mode:\n",
    "\n",
    "open(\"myfile.txt\", \"rb\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Opening a file is not enough. This open function needs to be stored into a variable as this will be used later for writing & reading the file. Here we will assign a variable to our file:\n",
