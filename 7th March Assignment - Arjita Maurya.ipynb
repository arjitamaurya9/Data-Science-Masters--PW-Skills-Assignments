The value of the covariance can range from negative infinity to positive infinity. A positive covariance indicates that the two variables tend to move in the same direction, while a negative covariance indicates that the two variables tend to move in opposite directions. A covariance of zero indicates that the two variables are uncorrelated.\n",

Correlation takes on values between -1 and 1, where a correlation of 1 indicates a perfect positive relationship, a correlation of -1 indicates a perfect negative relationship, and a correlation of 0 indicates no linear relationship. Correlation is a more commonly used measure than covariance, because it is standardized and easier to interpret. Correlation can also be used to compare the strength of the relationship between different pairs of variables on a common scale."
